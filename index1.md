### Threat Modeling: Designing for Security
Threat Modelling is a structured process through which IT pros can identify serious threats and vulnerability, quantify seriousness and prioritize techniques to mitigate attack & protect IT resources.


# Threat model should must fulfill following questions:
1.	What am I building ? – System desgn
2.	What can go wrong ? - STRIDE
3.	What are the mitigation plan to avoid/detect the wrongs ? – Identify threats
4.	Analysis of the system security -

## Ways to address threats:
1.	Mitigate threats
2.	Eliminate threats
3.	Transfer threats
4.	Accept the risk

## Visual Modelling :
-	Data Flow Diagarams
-	UML
-	Swim Lane
-	State Diagrams

## Properties of secure system:
1.	Authentication
2.	Authorization
3.	Integrity
4.	Confidentiality
5.	Availability
6.	Non-repudiation

## Threat Types ( STRIDE ) & Threats:
-	Spoofing : Pretending to be someone who you are not. Violation of authentication.
-	Tampering : Modifying data. Violation of integrity.
-	Repudiation : Claiming you didn’t do something (not taking responsibility of what was done) Violation of non-repudiation.
-	Information disclosure: Privacy breach. Violation of confidentiality.
-	Denial of Service : Prevent system to provide service. Violation of availability.
-	Elevation of privilege : Ability to perform tasks you are not authorised to. Violation of authorization.

## Attack Trees:
Alternative to STRIDE. The attack trees provide a formal methodical way of describing security of the system based on varying attacks. It represents attack against the system in a tree structure with goal as the root of the tree and different ways to achieve the goal in the leaf nodes.

## Attack Libraries :
-	Pick an attack library – target audience, details/abstraction of system, scope of the system
-	Common Attack Pattern Enumeration & Classification (CAPEC) by MITRE. System can be reviewed against 49 categories or 508 attack patterns in the CAPEC attack library.
-	Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) identifies top ten risks every year in field of application security.
 
## IDS/IPS/SIEM:
-	IDS (Intrusion Detection System) consists of a set of methods and techniques to reveal suspicious activity with a resource or IT resources. That is, events that suggest an anomaly in behaviour or incorrect or inappropriate use of a system.
-	IPSs are hardware or software devices that are responsible for reviewing traffic in a network in order to detect and respond to possible attacks or intrusions. The response consists of removing or modifying packets from the attack in such a way to frustrate their objective. This behaviour classifies them as proactive devices due to their automatic reaction to anomalous situations.
-	SIEM solutions are a hybrid solution of categories of products like SIM (Security Information Management) and SEM (Security Event Manager). SIEM technology provides a real-time analysis of security alerts generated by the network hardware and software. The SIEM solutions can come from software applications or administration services, and are also used to register security data and generate reports for compliance purposes.

## Network Firewall and WAF
- A Web Application Firewall is a network security firewall solution that protects web applications from HTTP/S and web application-based security vulnerabilities. The most common types of attacks which are targeted at web servers (Web Applications) : SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, DDoS attacks. It covers layer 7(Application) security solution. It uses proxy, packet filtering methods, etc.
-	Network Firewall is a device which controls access to a secured LAN network to protect it from unauthorized access. A firewall also controls inbound and outbound communications across devices. It covers layer 3 – 4 of OSI model. Common types of attacks are unauthorised users accessing private networks

## IDS vs Firewall
-	The most common difference between is that IDS and Firewall is that firewall examines headers (IP address, port number) while IDS examines the payload of the packets.
